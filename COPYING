The scanner icon was taken from
http://quantum-bits.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/epson-perfection-1260.tar.gz
and is equally GPL.

The PDF icon was taken from
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Gnome-mime-application-pdf.svg
and is LGPL.

I created the gscan2pdf icon by combining the above two icons.
